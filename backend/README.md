## JSMiniProject3-Aram-Arakelyan/backend

<details><summary>### ðŸ’« Project Description:</summary>

    The server part of the TumoLabs mini project 3 is based on the powerful server-side programming language Node.js, which provides high performance and scalability. This module accepts requests from the frontend and processes them, interacting with a remote MongoDB server to store and retrieve data.

    Using Node.js, our project provides efficient request processing, minimizing response time and ensuring stable operation. When requests are received from the client part of the application, the server part performs the necessary data processing and transfers it to the MongoDB server for storage or retrieval.

    The combination of Node.js and MongoDB provides flexibility and efficiency to the server side of the TumoLabs mini project 3, allowing you to easily scale and modify the application in accordance with the requirements of the project.
